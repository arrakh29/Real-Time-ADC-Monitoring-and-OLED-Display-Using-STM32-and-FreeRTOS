# Real-Time-ADC-Monitoring-and-OLED-Display-Using-STM32-and-FreeRTOS
This repository contains an STM32 project demonstrating the integration of an SSD1306 OLED display with FreeRTOS for real-time ADC monitoring and UART communication. The project is designed for an STM32 microcontroller, utilizing the SSD1306 OLED display to show ADC values while also transmitting the data over UART.
